# hello-world
my first github repository
I am 13 years old (I will turn 14 in 2 days) as of December 26, 2020. My parents are in the middle of a divorce and my dad is the one who wanted it. I am in theirpy at the moment. My dad is really mean as in he won't give the xbox 360 he talks mean and it keep having nightmares that he is killing us and he won't give our dog back (our dog's name is Arlo, he is the best dog ever)
As you can tell I am a dog person. they make me feel so good and happy.
My mother is a coder and she is looking for a job.
Her github account is called Sarah-marie and if you want to hire her for a coding job you can notify her.
(this readme won't be updated because I want to keep it how it was when I followed the Hello World tutorial).
P.S I love my family and God and Jesus and also MINECRAFT.
